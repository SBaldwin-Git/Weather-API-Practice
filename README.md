# Weather-API-Practice

Personal small project to practice api's and bootstrap.
This was started so i could learn an api that was not provided as part of the SSchool of Code workshops. My SoC mentor recommended using the Open Meteo weather API as a great example of a free API i could try myself.

I also wanted a project I could try Bootstrap with, in order to familiarise myself with the syntax and experience using it in a personal project.

The API and documentation for the weather API can be found here https://open-meteo.com/
